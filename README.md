# ArkForge Agent Client

[![GitHub Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ark-forge/arkforge-agent-client?style=flat&label=Star)](https://github.com/ark-forge/arkforge-agent-client/stargazers)

A proof-of-concept demonstrating **autonomous agent-to-agent paid transactions** through the [ArkForge Trust Layer](https://github.com/ark-forge/trust-layer).

One agent (this client) calls another agent (the [ArkForge MCP EU AI Act](https://github.com/ark-forge/mcp-eu-ai-act) scanner) to scan a code repository for EU AI Act compliance. Every transaction flows through the Trust Layer, which produces a tamper-proof cryptographic proof (SHA-256 chain + Ed25519 signature + RFC 3161 certified timestamp).

No human clicks, no browser, no manual approval.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get an API key

**Free plan** — no card required:

```bash
curl -X POST https://arkforge.fr/trust/v1/keys/free-signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your@email.com"}'
```

Your `mcp_free_*` API key will be emailed automatically. 100 calls/month, 2 witnesses (no Stripe).

**Pro plan** — buy initial credits and save card (once):

**Option A — via setup_card.py:**

```bash
python3 setup_card.py your@email.com --test    # Test mode (Stripe test card)
python3 setup_card.py your@email.com           # Live mode (real charges)
```

**Option B — via curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://arkforge.fr/trust/v1/keys/setup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your@email.com", "mode": "test", "amount": 10}'
```

Open the returned `checkout_url` in a browser. The initial purchase (minimum 10 EUR = 100 proofs) is charged immediately and your card is saved for future top-ups. For test mode, use Stripe test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` (any future expiry, any CVC). Your API key and credits are set up automatically after payment.

### 2. Top up credits (Pro plan)

Buy more credits any time — the saved card is charged directly, no browser required.

**Via agent.py:**

```bash
pip install requests
export TRUST_LAYER_API_KEY="mcp_pro_..."
python3 agent.py credits 10    # Buy 10 EUR = 100 proofs — receipt auto-saved
```

**Via curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://arkforge.fr/trust/v1/credits/buy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: mcp_pro_..." \
  -d '{"amount": 10}'
# Returns: {"credits_added": 10.0, "balance": 10.0, "proofs_available": 100, ...}
```

Each proof costs 0.10 EUR. Min 1 EUR, max 100 EUR. Credits are deducted automatically on each proxy call. Credits never expire.

### 3. Run a scan

```bash
export TRUST_LAYER_API_KEY="mcp_test_..."    # or mcp_pro_... for live
python3 agent.py scan https://github.com/owner/repo
```

If you purchased credits earlier, the saved receipt is **auto-attached** as payment evidence. You can also provide one manually:

```bash
python3 agent.py scan https://github.com/owner/repo \
  --receipt-url "https://pay.stripe.com/receipts/payment/CAcaFwoV..."
```

To skip auto-attach for a single call:

```bash
python3 agent.py scan https://github.com/owner/repo --no-receipt
```

**Mode B PoC — pay the scan provider directly via Stripe:**

```bash
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."       # your agent's Stripe key
export STRIPE_PAYMENT_METHOD="pm_xxx"        # saved payment method
export SCAN_PROVIDER_PRICE="100"             # optional, cents EUR (default: 100 = 1.00 EUR)
python3 agent.py scan https://github.com/owner/repo --pay-provider
```

The agent creates a Stripe `PaymentIntent` off-session, retrieves the `receipt_url` from the resulting `Charge`, and attaches it automatically as `provider_payment` to the Trust Layer call. ArkForge does not handle this money — the payment goes directly between agents.

### 4. Just pay (no scan)

```bash
python3 agent.py pay                     # auto-attaches saved receipt if any
python3 agent.py pay --no-receipt        # skip auto-attach
python3 agent.py pay --receipt-url "https://pay.stripe.com/receipts/payment/..."
```

### 5. Verify a proof

```bash
python3 agent.py verify prf_20260225_171714_4ebb28
```

### 6. Check reputation

```bash
python3 agent.py reputation <agent_id>
```

```
============================================================
AGENT REPUTATION
============================================================
  Agent:       sha256:buyer_abc123...
  Score:       85/100
  Success rate:  100.0%
  Confidence:    0.85
  Formula:       floor(success_rate × confidence) − penalties
  Total proofs:  10
  Signature:   ed25519:T3hY8kLm9nPq...(verified)
============================================================
```

The score is publicly auditable: `score = floor(success_rate × confidence)`.
Confidence grows with volume (0.60 at 1 proof → 1.00 at 20+ proofs).
One optional penalty: −15 if the agent changed its declared identity.

### 7. File a dispute

```bash
python3 agent.py dispute prf_20260301_120000_abc123 "Response was empty"
```

```

```

The proof is emitted with `spec_version: 2.0` and includes `receipt_content_hash` in the chain.

## Library usage

`agent.py` can be imported as a Python module:

```python
from agent import scan_repo, verify_proof, get_reputation, file_dispute, get_disputes

# All functions return dicts — check for "error" key on failure
result = scan_repo("https://github.com/owner/repo")
if "error" in result:
    print(result["error"])
else:
    proof = result["proof"]
    print(proof["proof_id"])

# Public endpoints (no API key required)
rep = get_reputation("buyer_abc123")
disputes = get_disputes("buyer_abc123")

# Authenticated endpoints (TRUST_LAYER_API_KEY env var)
result = file_dispute("prf_...", "Response was empty")
```

Config is read from environment variables at call time, so you can set them after import:

```python
import os
os.environ["TRUST_LAYER_API_KEY"] = "mcp_pro_..."
os.environ["TRUST_LAYER_BASE"] = "http://localhost:8100"  # local dev

from agent import scan_repo
result = scan_repo("https://github.com/owner/repo")
```

## Why does this matter?

AI agents are starting to act on behalf of humans — browsing, coding, deploying. The next step is agents **paying for services autonomously**. But autonomous payments create a trust problem:

- How does the buyer agent know it got what it paid for?
- How does the seller agent prove it delivered?
- How does the human owner verify what happened?

## How the Trust Layer works

Every transaction produces a chain of verifiable proofs:

```
Agent Client
    |
    v
Trust Layer (/v1/proxy)
    |--- Validates API key
    |--- Debits prepaid credits (Pro only — Free skips this)
    |--- Fetches external receipt if --receipt-url provided (optional)
    |--- Forwards scan request to upstream API
    |--- Hashes request + response (SHA-256 chain)
    |--- Binds receipt content hash to chain (if present)
    |--- Signs with Ed25519
    |--- Submits to RFC 3161 TSA (certified timestamp)
    |--- Returns proof + scan result
    |
    v
Agent receives: scan report + cryptographic proof [+ payment evidence]
```

**Each layer is independently verifiable:**

| Proof | Verified by | Can be faked? | Plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ed25519 signature | Verify with ArkForge public key | No (cryptographic) | All |
| SHA-256 hash chain | Trust Layer verification URL | No (deterministic) | All |
| RFC 3161 TSA | `openssl ts -verify` | No (certified by trusted TSA) | All |
| Stripe receipt | Stripe dashboard (for credit purchase) | No (Stripe is source of truth) | Pro only |
| External receipt | `--receipt-url` — fetched, hashed, bound to proof | No (SHA-256 of raw content) | All (optional) |
| Scan result | Re-running scan on same repo | No (deterministic) | All |
| Local log | `logs/*.json` + `proofs/*.json` | Tamper-evident (contains hashes) | All |

### Three-layer proof system

Every transaction carries the ArkForge mark at 3 levels:

| Level | Where | For whom | What |
|-------|-------|----------|------|
| **1 — Digital Stamp** | `service_response.body._arkforge_attestation` | Agents (JSON consumers) | Proof ID, seal URL, verification status |
| **2 — Ghost Stamp** | HTTP response headers | Infra / monitoring | `X-ArkForge-Verified`, `X-ArkForge-Proof-ID`, `X-ArkForge-Trust-Link` |
| **3 — Visual Stamp** | HTML proof page | Humans / legal | Colored badge (green/orange/red), full proof details |

Open any proof in a browser: `https://arkforge.fr/trust/v/prf_...` — the short URL redirects to a self-contained HTML page with all verification details.

## Transparency Notice

Both this agent (buyer) and the ArkForge scan API (seller) are built and controlled by the same team (ArkForge). This is a proof-of-concept — not an attempt to simulate independent entities. The architecture is designed so that it **would work identically** between independent parties.

## Proof fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `proof.spec_version` | Proof format version: `1.1` (standard) or `2.0` (with receipt). See [proof-spec](https://github.com/ark-forge/proof-spec) |
| `proof.arkforge_signature` | Ed25519 signature of the chain hash |
| `proof.arkforge_pubkey` | ArkForge's public key for verification |
| `proof.upstream_timestamp` | Upstream service's `Date` header |
| `proof.timestamp_authority.tsr_base64` | Embedded TSR file (base64, available after background processing) |
| `proof.provider_payment` | Provider payment receipt verification — present when `--receipt-url` or `--pay-provider` was used (Mode B). Not the ArkForge certification fee. |
| `proof.provider_payment.receipt_content_hash` | SHA-256 of raw receipt bytes — bound to chain hash (triggers spec 2.0) |
| `proof.provider_payment.parsed_fields` | Extracted amount, currency, status, date (best-effort) |
| `proof.transaction_success` | Whether the upstream service returned a success response (HTTP status < 400) |
| `proof.upstream_status_code` | HTTP status code returned by the upstream service |
| `proof.disputed` | Whether this proof has been disputed |
| `proof.dispute_id` | Reference to the dispute record (e.g. `disp_a1b2c3d4`) |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `python3 agent.py scan <repo_url>` | Scan repo via Trust Layer (auto-attaches saved receipt) |
| `python3 agent.py scan <repo_url> --pay-provider` | Mode B PoC: pay provider via Stripe then scan (proof spec 2.0) |
| `python3 agent.py scan <repo_url> --receipt-url URL` | Attach a manual provider receipt (Mode B, manual) |
| `python3 agent.py scan <repo_url> --no-receipt` | Skip auto-attach for this call |
| `python3 agent.py pay [--receipt-url URL] [--no-receipt]` | Payment + proof only (auto-attaches saved receipt) |
| `python3 agent.py credits <amount>` | Buy prepaid credits — **saves receipt URL** for future calls |
| `python3 agent.py verify <proof_id>` | Verify an existing proof (shows payment evidence if present) |
| `python3 agent.py reputation <agent_id>` | Check agent reputation score (0-100) |
| `python3 agent.py dispute <proof_id> "reason"` | File a dispute against a proof |
| `python3 agent.py disputes <agent_id>` | View dispute history for an agent |

## Plans

| Key prefix | Plan | Stripe | Witnesses | Limits |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mcp_free_*` | Free | No | 2 (Ed25519, RFC 3161 TSA) + optional external receipt | 100/month |
| `mcp_test_*` | Test | Test mode (no real charges) | 2 + optional external receipt | Dev only |
| `mcp_pro_*` | Pro | Prepaid credits (0.10 EUR/proof) | 2 (+ Stripe receipt) + optional external receipt | 100/day |

## Prerequisites
